# Malware-Detection-Using-Machine_Learning


In the modern world, technology is always developing, which leads to a growth in the creation of malware and other hazardous practices that provide thieves access to confidential information and passwords. Hackers can steal data and carry out other unlawful activities thanks to the advancements in technology today, which motivate them to write and run dangerous code. This is why malware detection is important since it enables us to spot malware early on and stop devices from being targeted. Although many different detection techniques have been developed, machine learning techniques can be utilized to further enhance them because they are precise and effective. In this paper, I will using machine learning techniques, namely the Random Forest, XGboost & KNN algorithm, to identify malware using a datasets that will be trained. The XGboost algorithm will be employed since it is more accurate and produces predictable results due to the mathematical operations it contains. We will be testing the behavior & signature-based algorithm detection, in this study, and the dataset will be obtained from virusshare.com. The total number of records available is 138,048 (50mb). It has valid files including malicious and non-malicious files. All are .exe files with the available information about the file Memory Header information (code size, ImageSize, etc).




Keywords: Windows Malware, Malware Analysis, Signature Base Malware Analysis, Malware Classification.


Dataset Description

The data set is the initial part of the malware detection system. The data set is an accurate compilation of malicious and useful applications. For malware behaviour analysis, a suitable dataset is crucial. For accurate identification, we need instances of both malicious software and legitimate programmes. To find dataset we used virusshare.com most popular sources of Windows malware.



Future Work
 
It would be fascinating to examine how the authors' implementations might alter the findings given that this research is constrained by the way the methods were used. Therefore, looking into papers with accessible source code may be a future study subject. The implementation won't need to be validated, and the outcomes will be more obvious. It may be feasible to find out how much the algorithm performance differs since only three methods from a technique may cover the entire area. What would happen, for instance, if the CNN technique was chosen? The research' conclusions and future work have an impact. What factors and characteristics would result in the best performance. The dataset has a significant influence on how well an algorithm performs. It would be fascinating to compare the differences between various dataset types. Whether it is public or not, it was gathered via malware databases. Whether or not malware is encrypted, packaged, or obfuscated in any way is another issue.
